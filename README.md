Movies is a simple to show movies, search movies using "starts with binary search algorithm", see movie details such as movie synopsis, cast, reviews, similar movies.

## Features

- [x] VIPER
- [x] Dark Mode Support
- [x] Code based UI development (No xib, no No storyoard)
- [x] Caching of images
- [x] Caching of searched results
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Useful Extensions
- [x] Git braching module wise
- [x] Binary Search Algorithm

## Implementation Description

Things taken care at the development.

1. Modular: I have tried to split the design in views and hence implemented each of the view object in a UIView class. So that it can be used anywhere from a tableviewcell to collectionview cell to any viewcontroller's view. 
2. Gitable: Tried to maintain sanity of modularity using git branches with the concept of having to generic, feature[s], UI[s] based branching.
3. Discardable: Using VIPER, any part of the code can be discarded.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0, 9.0+
- Xcode 11.0, 12.0+
- Swift 5.0+
